# First, we need to make sure that the name of the branch matches the pattern we've established.
# i.e., `vX-Y-Z`, where X, Y, and Z are numbers.
# Note: [[:digit:]] is the bash-equivalent of the \d special character.

# Next, we need to make sure that the branch's name matches the version defined in the package.json. Do that by...
# - Logging the package.json with `cat`
# - Feeding that through `jq` and pulling out the "version" property
# - Replacing the dots in the version property with dashes.
# - Using xargs to strip off the leading and trailing quotes.
# - Tacking a 'v' onto the start.

# Finally, we need to make sure that the branch has all of the same commits as the `release` branch.
# Fetch release from origin, since we might not necessarily have it yet.
git fetch origin release
# Also fetch the branch we were given. This shouldn't be strictly necessary, but it lets us run the script against branches
# beyond the current branch.
git fetch origin ${SCANNER_BRANCH}

# Compare the commits on both branches by using the `git log` command, then pipe that into `wc` to get the character count,
# and use xargs to trim white space.
